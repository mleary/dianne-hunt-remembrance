## Remembering our dear friend

On August 23, 2021, our dear friend, Dianne Grace Hunt, left the well-worn trails of earth to eternally hike new trails and walk among the beautiful flowers she loved so much. 

Dianne had a passion for nature and shared this love with friends, teaching about the various “native” species of flowers, trees, and birds at every opportunity. Dianne’s life was one of travel and adventure, taking the time to meet people everywhere she went and developing life-long friendships all along the way. Her friendliness and enthusiasm were contagious, touching the lives of all those with which she shared her generous spirit.
 
Dianne’s Celebration of Life was held virtually on October 2, 2021. We invite you to watch the recording of the celebration and enjoy seeing the many admirable aspects of her life that inspired her many friends. Remembrances of Dianne are also available to read.
