## Remembering our dear friend
Our dear friend, Dianne Grace Hunt of Rohnert Park, left the well-worn trails of earth to eternally hike new trails and walk among the beautiful flowers she loved so much in the late afternoon of August 23, 2021, in Santa Clara, California.


Dianne had a passion for nature and shared this love with friends teaching about the various “native” species of flowers, trees, and birds at every opportunity. Dianne’s life was one of travel and adventure, taking the time to meet people everywhere she went and developing life-long friendships all along the way.
